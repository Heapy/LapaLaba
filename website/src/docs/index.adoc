== What is Stream?

Stream is simply list of cards. Every card can have some global action, like `delay`, `depends on`, `archive`, and unique card specific actions.

Imagine card which aims to track your habbits. You setup few habbits with specific dates and time, and sometimes you see card which asks you: "Are wakeup early today? Y/N". Or you subscribed for podcast, and when new episode released, card with shownotes and podcast transcript (thx speech-to-text) appears, and asking you: are you like to listen it? Also you can receive card with weather for today, reminders and tasks.
